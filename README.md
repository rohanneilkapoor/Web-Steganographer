This consists of an open hash table created from scratch with a history feature to track each hash element's location in the order in which they were added. It contains all CRUD features as well. The rest of the project utilizes this hash table to both encode and decode hidden messages in website source files. The LZW compression algorithm and website scraper were provided.
